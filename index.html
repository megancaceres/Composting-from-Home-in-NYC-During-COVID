      Composting at Home in New York City During COVID 19
    </h1>
    <p>
      New York Cityâ€™s composting program is part of the Zero Waste initiative, which aims to achieve a 90 percent reduction in landfill use by 2030.
    </p>

      Food Scrap Drop-off sites and Curbside Composting services were suspended throughout NYC due to budget cuts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the many downsides of this pandemic is the suspension of city programs,
      such as the curbside composting program in NYC.
